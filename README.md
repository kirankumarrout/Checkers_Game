##Checkers Game




Overview:
This is a classic Checkers game implemented in [language/technology used, e.g., Python, JavaScript, etc.]. The game allows two players to compete against each other in a standard 8x8 checkers board. It supports all the traditional rules of the game, including capturing, kinging, and forced moves. The project was designed as a learning exercise to explore game development, UI design, and algorithm implementation.

Features:
Two-Player Mode: Play against another person locally.
Standard Rules: Adheres to the official checkers rules, including mandatory captures and kinging.
Interactive UI: Simple and user-friendly interface for easy gameplay.
Move Validation: Ensures only legal moves are allowed, preventing any game rule violations.
Undo Feature: Allows players to undo the last move in case of mistakes (optional).
Customizable Board: Option to change the board and piece colors.




Usage:
Launch the game and start playing by selecting the piece you want to move and the destination square.
The game will automatically handle piece capturing and kinging.
The first player to capture all of the opponent's pieces or block them from making a move wins!
